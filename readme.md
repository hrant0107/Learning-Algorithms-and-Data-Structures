# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview

This repository is a personal project by Hrant Harutyunyan, a JavaScript developer, to learn and implement various algorithms and data structures. The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, practice coding problems, and showcase my implementations of different algorithms and data structures.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hrantharutyunyan/learning-algorithms-and-data-structures.git
    cd learning-algorithms-and-data-structures
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    This repository primarily uses JavaScript. If any dependencies are required, they will be mentioned in the specific folders. Generally, you might want to set up a Node.js environment.

3. **Run the code**:
    Each algorithm and data structure will have its own README with instructions on how to run the code examples.
