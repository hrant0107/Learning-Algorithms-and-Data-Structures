# Linear Search Algorithm

## Overview

The linear search algorithm is a straightforward method to find a target value within an array by iterating through each element sequentially until the target is found or all elements have been checked.

## Running the Code

To run the code:
1. Copy the function `linearSearch` into a JavaScript file ( `linear-search.js`).
2. Save the file and execute it using Node.js in your terminal:
   
   ```bash
   node linear-search.js
   ```
